To get Meeting objects to show on your calendar portlet: in the ZMI
of the site, go to portal_calendar -> Configure tab, then in the
"Portal Types to show in the calendar" list, Control-click or
Command-click the Meeting type so that both Event and Meeting types
are selected.  Then press Submit at the bottom of the page.

Remember: the calendar portlet will show only PUBLISHED items, as
per that Configure tab's default settings, so if you want a Meeting
(or an Event) to show up in the portlet, the Meeting or Event must
be published too.
